Music Transcriber App is a user-friendly Python Flask web application that enables users to upload an audio file (supports `.wav`, `.mp3`, `.flac`, `.ogg`) and extract musical components from it. With this app, you can easily perform source separation—such as isolating guitar—and automatically receive:

- The separated audio track (e.g., guitar only and non-guitar)
- The MIDI file for the separated audio
- The corresponding musical notation as a PDF

This project can be useful to musicians by providing separate instrument tracks, lyrics, midi, as well as the notation of any song. Although the separation or transcription may not be completely accurate, it can definitely serve as a solid point of reference for the musician to get a general idea of the section they wish to practice. They will also be able to play their instrument along with the song after practicing, with the instrument-less part playing on their device (like karaoke but for their instrument instead of vocals).

## Features

- 🎵 **Audio Upload:** Supports common formats like WAV, MP3, FLAC, and OGG.
- 🥁 **Source Separation:** Choose which instrument to extract (e.g., drums), and the app separates out the desired track.
- 🎼 **MIDI & Notation:** Generates a MIDI file and a printable PDF of musical notation for the isolated track.
- 🎤 **Lyrics Lookup:** Fetches lyrics from various sources given song name and artist name.
- 📦 **Containerized Deployment:** Easily run anywhere using Docker.

### Manual Setup (Ubuntu Linux)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thekaushalk/music-transcriber-app.git
cd music-transcriber-app
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

## Usage

1. Upload an audio file (`.wav`, `.mp3`, `.flac`, `.ogg`).
2. Choose which instrument to separate (e.g., drums).
3. Click **Transcribe**.
4. Download:
   - The separated audio file (e.g., drums only)
   - MIDI file of the track
   - Printable PDF with musical notation
   - The audio file with the selected instrument removed

## Output Example

For a drum selection:
- `drums.mp3` — Audio file containing only drums
- `drums.mid` — MIDI MIDI file for the drum track
- `drums.pdf` — Musical notation (PDF) of the drum part
- `no_drums.mp3` — Remaining audio with the drums removed
